      <p>(tl;dr <a class="link" href="resume.pdf" target="_blank">résumé</a>)</p>
      <p><b>Hello! My name is Thomas.</b> I am a human with a passion for technology and design currently
        based in Chicago, IL. I am currently a <b>Senior Software Development Engineer</b> at <a class="bold link" href="http://www.4cinsights.com" target="_blank">4C Insights</a>.
        I have a <b>B.S. in Computer Science</b> from Loyola University Chicago.</p>
      <p>As an Engineer at <a class="link" href="http://www.4cinsights.com" target="_blank">4C</a>, I mainly work on a SaaS ads management tool for ad activation, planning and measuring in premium marketplaces.
        <b>Currently I am helping to spearhead an effort to transition our entire frontend codebase to React</b> from Ember.js by creating a solid reusable component library for cross-platform usage.
        Lately I have spent time pushing foward our CI/CD efforts and working to get our application in a highly available Kubernetes cluster.
        I am part of a small team that <b>planned and built (and continues to do so!) a cross-publisher audience creation and management tool</b>. Users can target, build, upload and expansion
        model audiences based on different inputs to use cross-channel. I work with multiple third-party API and data integrations as well as with
        4C's own in-house data for audience building, data manipulation and publishing. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to <b>help lead and maintain the building and design of a
        high-level data visualization tool</b> that makes use of TV and social data to help brands better understand their impact and gain audience insights in addition
        to how they compare to their competitors. I <b>built a chat-ops bot</b> to help the team monitor the status of our continuous integration tests and manage our continous deployments and tools pipeline. I also <b>mentor
        junior engineers</b> and often help evaluate engineering candidates.</p>
      <p>In the processing of building and working at <a class="link" href="http://www.4cinsights.com" target="_blank">4C</a>, I've gained experience working with a full stack of <b>languages such as JavaScript (ES6), Python</b>, HTML, CSS/LESS/SCSS,
        Node.js and technologies such as <b>React</b>, Ember.js, Flask, <b>MySQL</b>, <b>MongoDB</b>, <b>Redis</b>, Redux, Immutable.js, AWS, SQLAlchemy and Celery.</p>
      <p>I spend much of my free time researching and exploring the confluence of technology, design and climate change/human rights. And decentralized technologies (very excited about IPFS).
        I love to <a class="link" href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/16679686" target="_blank">run</a>, cook/bake, travel and read (currently <a class="link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464310" target="_blank">
        Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow</a>). I also enjoy <a class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/thomasjfox_/" target="_blank">photography</a>,
        <a class="link" href="cartography/">cartography</a>, biking and hiking.</p>
