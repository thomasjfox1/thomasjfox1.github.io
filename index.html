      <p>(tl;dr <a class="link" href="resume.pdf" target="_blank">résumé</a>)</p>
      <p><b>Hello! My name is Thomas.</b> I am a human with a passion for technology and design
        based in Chicago, IL. I am currently a <b>Lead Software Development Engineer</b> at <a class="bold link" href="http://www.4cinsights.com" target="_blank">4C Insights</a>.
        I have a <b>B.S. in Computer Science</b> (<i>magna cum laude</i>) from Loyola University Chicago.</p>
      <p>As a Lead Engineer at <a class="link" href="http://www.4cinsights.com" target="_blank">4C</a>, <b>I manage a small full stack team focused on making 4C’s platform self-serve and enhancing its user experience.</b>
        The team has a tight feedback loop between the Engineering, Product/Design and Revenue departments with our users to make targeted improvements that benefit the near and long-term company goals — including making all of our customers more profitable. The team and myself are working
        on a user administration tool to empower users and reduce client dependance on 4C’s Client Success team, as well as other initiatives like platform notifications, user tracking and improvements to accessibility.</p>
      <p><b>I am also helping to spearhead an effort to transition our entire frontend codebase to React</b> from Ember.js by creating a solid reusable component library for cross-platform usage.
        Lately, I have spent time pushing foward our CI/CD efforts and working to get our application in a highly available bare-metal Kubernetes cluster. <b>As part of my work with Kubernetes, I have been helping
        to transition our monolith application to a service-based architecture</b>, including a system of distributed worker queues.</p>
      <p>Prior to becoming a Lead, I mainly worked on 4C's SaaS ads management tool for ad activation, planning and measuring in premium marketplaces. I was part of a team that <b>architected and built a cross-publisher audience creation and management tool</b>. Users can target, build, upload and expansion
        model audiences based on different inputs to use cross-channel. I worked with multiple third-party API and data integrations as well as with
        4C's own in-house data for audience building, data manipulation and publishing. Additionally, I had the opportunity to <b>help lead and maintain the building and design of a
        high-level data visualization tool</b> that makes use of TV and social data to help brands better understand their reach, gain audience insights and
        to show how they compare to their competitors. I also <b>built and maintain a chat-ops bot</b> to help the team monitor the status of our continuous integration tests and manage our continous deployments and tools pipeline.
        It integrates with GitHub, our Jenkins test runner and our build server. I also <b>mentor junior engineers</b> and often help evaluate and interview engineering candidates.</p>
      <p>In the processing of building and working at <a class="link" href="http://www.4cinsights.com" target="_blank">4C</a>, I've gained experience working with a full stack of <b>languages such as JavaScript (ES6), Python</b>, HTML, CSS/LESS/SCSS,
        Node.js and technologies such as <b>React</b>, Ember.js, Flask, <b>MySQL</b>, <b>MongoDB</b>, <b>Redis</b>, RabbitMQ, <b>Kubernetes, Docker</b>, Redux, Immutable.js, AWS, SQLAlchemy and Celery.</p>
      <p>I spend much of my free time researching and exploring the confluence of technology, design and climate change/human rights.
        I love to <a class="link" href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/16679686" target="_blank">run</a>, cook/bake, travel and read (currently <a class="link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Uninhabitable-Earth-Life-After-Warming/dp/0525576703/" target="_blank">
        <i>The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming</i></a>). I also enjoy <a class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/thomasjfox_/" target="_blank">photography</a>,
        <a class="link" href="cartography/">cartography</a>, biking and hiking.</p>
